# Radial Wave Function

## Radial Wave Function in General

- separation of variables rewrites the stationary states of the wave function
  as $\psi(\vb{r}) = R(r) Y(\theta, \phi)$
- for the sake of simplification, a new variable $u$ is defined, such that
  $u(r) = r R(r)$
- the time-independent "radial equation" is thus given by
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \dod[2]{u}{r} +
\qty[ V + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{r^2} ] u =
E u.
$$
- this is identical to the one-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation, except
  the effective potential contains an additional component
$$V_{\rm eff} = V + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{r^2}$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- the hydrogen atom is comprised by a proton of charge $e$, and an electron of
  charge $-e$
- the proton may be thought to be motionless and centered at the origin
- by Coulomb's law, we may express the potential energy as
$$V(r) = -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{1}{r}$$
- we substitute this into the radial equation
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \dod[2]{u}{r} +
\qty[ -\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{1}{r}
     + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{r^2} ] u =
E u.
$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- the Coulomb potential admits both
    - continuum states ($E > 0$), describing electron-proton stattering
    - discrete bound states ($E < 0$), describing the hydrogen atom
- we simplify the notation by introducing $\kappa$, defined by
$$\kappa = \frac{\sqrt{-2 m E}}{\hbar}$$
- we are only interested in bound states,
  so $E$ is negative, so $\kappa$ is real


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- dividing the wave equation by $E$, in terms of $m$ and $\kappa$, we obtain
$$
\frac{1}{\kappa^2} \dod[2]{u}{r} =
\qty[
 1
-\frac{m e^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2 \kappa} \frac{1}{(\kappa r)}
+\frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{(\kappa r)^2}
] u
$$
- let $\rho = \kappa r$
  and $\rho_0 = m e^2 / (2 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2 \kappa)$
$$\dod[2]{u}{\rho} =
  \qty[ 1 - \frac{\rho_0}{\rho} + \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{\rho^2} ] u$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

$$\dod[2]{u}{\rho} =
  \qty[ 1 - \frac{\rho_0}{\rho} + \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{\rho^2} ] u$$
- as $\rho \to \infty$, the equation simplifies to
$$\dod[2]{u}{\rho} = u$$
- which has general solution
$$u(\rho) = A \exp(-\rho) + B \exp(\rho)$$
- since $\exp(\rho) \to \infty$ as $\rho \to \infty$, $B = 0$ for large $\rho$
$$u(\rho) \sim A \exp(-\rho)$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

$$\dod[2]{u}{\rho} =
  \qty[ 1 - \frac{\rho_0}{\rho} + \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{\rho^2} ] u$$
- as $\rho \to 0$, the equation simplifies to
$$\dod[2]{u}{\rho} = \frac{\ell (\ell + 1)}{\rho^2} u$$
- which has general solution
$$u(\rho) = C \rho^{\ell + 1} + D \rho^{-\ell}$$
- as $\rho \to 0$, $\rho^{-\ell} \to \infty$, so $D = 0$
$$u(\rho) \sim C \rho^{\ell + 1}$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- we introduce a new function, $v(\rho)$, defined implicitly by
$$u(\rho) = v(\rho) \rho^{\ell+1} e^{-\rho}$$
- it is simply $u(\rho)$ stripped of its asymptotic behaviour
- we compute $\od{u}{\rho}$ and $\od[2]{u}{\rho}$, and substitute into the
  radial equation, giving:
$$
\rho \dod[2]{v}{\rho} +
2 (\ell + 1 - \rho) \dod{v}{\rho} +
\qty[ \rho_0 - 2 (\ell + 1) ] v =
0
$$
- the solution to $v(\rho)$ can be given by the power series
$$v(\rho) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j \rho^j$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

$$v(\rho) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j \rho^j$$
- to find the coefficients, $c_0$, $c_1$, ..., we first find the derivatives
\begin{align*}
\dod{v}{\rho} &=
\sum_{j=0}^\infty j c_j \rho^{j-1} =
\sum_{j=0}^\infty (j+1) c_{j+1} \rho^j
\\
\dod[2]{v}{\rho} &=
\sum_{j=0}^\infty j (j+1) c_{j+1} \rho^{j-1}
\end{align*}


## Wave Function of Hydrogen


- recall the wave equation was given by
$$
\rho \dod[2]{v}{\rho} +
2 (\ell + 1 - \rho) \dod{v}{\rho} +
\qty[ \rho_0 - 2 (\ell + 1) ] v =
0
$$
- substituting $v(\rho)$, $\od{v}{\rho}$, and $\od[2]{v}{\rho}$ we obtain
\begin{align*}
&
\sum_{j=0}^\infty j (j+1) c_{j+1} \rho^j +
2 (\ell + 1)
\sum_{j=0}^\infty (j+1) c_{j+1} \rho^j
\\ -&
2
\sum_{j=0}^\infty j c_j \rho^j +
\qty[ \rho_0 - 2 (\ell + 1) ]
\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j \rho^j =
0
\end{align*}


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- dividing through by $\rho^j$ gives us
$$
j (j+1) c_{j+1} +
2 (\ell+1) (j+1) c_{j+1} -
2 j c_j +
\qty[ \rho_0 - 2 (\ell+1) ] c_j =
0
$$
- solving for $c_{j+1}$ gives us the recursive definition
$$
c_{j+1} =
\frac{2 (j+\ell+1) - \rho_0}{(j+1) (j+2\ell+2)} c_j
$$
- for large values of $j$, we have
$$
c_{j+1} \approx
\frac{2 j}{j (j+1)} c_j =
\frac{2}{j+1} c_j
$$


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

$$
c_{j+1} \approx
\frac{2 j}{j (j+1)} c_j =
\frac{2}{j+1} c_j
$$
- if this approximation were exact, then we would have
$$c_j = \frac{2^j}{j!} c_0$$
- implying
$$v(\rho) = c_0 \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{2^j}{j!} \rho^j = c_0 e^{2\rho}$$
- so $u(\rho)$ displays asymptotic behaviour, which we tried to get rid of


## Wave Function of Hydrogen

- it seems that there is only one way to deal with the issue of asymptotic
  behaviour: the series must be finite
- there must exist a maximum $j$, such that
$$c_{j_{\rm max} + 1} = 0$$
- implying
$$2 (j_{\rm max} + \ell + 1) = \rho_0$$
- we now define the **principal quantum number** to be
$$n \equiv j_{\rm max} + \ell + 1$$
- meaning
$$2 n = \rho_0$$

# Results

## Spectrum of Hydrogen

- energy depends on $\rho_0$
$$
E =
-\frac{\hbar^2 \kappa^2}{2 m} =
-\frac{m e^4}{8 \pi^2 \varepsilon_0^2 \hbar^2 \rho_0^2}
$$
- the allowed energies are thus given by
$$
E_n =
-\qty[ \frac{m}{2 \hbar^2} \qty( \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} )^2]
\frac{1}{n^2} =
\frac{E_1}{n^2}
$$
where $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$


## Bohr Radius

- recall
$$\rho_0 \equiv \frac{m e^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2 \kappa} = 2 n$$
- solving for $\kappa$ gives
$$
\kappa =
\qty( \frac{m e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} ) \frac{1}{n} =
\frac{1}{a n}
$$
- where $a$ is the Bohr Radius
$$
a =
\frac{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m e^2} \approx
\SI{5.29e-11}{\meter}
$$
- from the definition of $\rho$ we see
$$\rho = \frac{r}{a n}$$


## Quantum Numbers

- we have thus far seen three quantum numbers, $n$, $\ell$, and $m$
- the spatial wave functions for hydrogen are separated as
$$\psi_{n \ell m}(r, \theta, \phi) = R_{n \ell}(r) Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$$
- from Section 4.1 we have
$$R_{n \ell}(r) = \frac{1}{r} \rho^{\ell+1} e^{-\rho} v(\rho)$$
- the ground state occurs when $n=1$, so the binding energy is given by
$$
E_1 =
-\qty[ \frac{m}{2\hbar} \qty( \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} )^2 ] =
\SI{-13.6}{\electronvolt}
$$

## Ground State

- consider $\psi_{100}(r, \theta, \phi) = R_{10}(r) Y_0^0(\theta, \phi)$
$$R_{10}(r) = \frac{c_0}{a} \exp(-r/a)$$
- normalizing gives $c_0$
$$
\int_0^\infty \abs{R_{10}}^2 r^2 \dif r =
\frac{\abs{c_0}^2}{a^2} \int_0^\infty \exp(-2 r / a) r^2 \dif r =
\abs{c_0}^2 \frac{a}{4} = 1
$$
$$c_0 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{a}}$$
$$Y_0^0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi}}$$
- the ground state of Hydrogen is given by
$$
\psi_{100}(r, \theta, \phi) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a^3}} \exp(-r / a)
$$
