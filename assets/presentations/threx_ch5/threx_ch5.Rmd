# X-Ray Scattering

## History

- X-Rays discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895

    - Awarded the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901 for his discovery

- Thought to be EM radiation, but difficult to refract and diffract

    - Shorter wavelengths?

- X-Rays proven to be EM radiation by Max von Laue


## Laue Experiment

- Wave properties most easily demonstrated with aperture or obstruction equal
  or smaller than the wavelength

- X-Ray wavelength estimated to be on the order of $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-11}$
  meters

- von Laue suggested using crystals, due to their tight lattice spacing

- Demonstrated both the wave nature of X-Rays and the lattice structure of
  crystals

- Won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1914

## Bragg Experiment

- William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg built on Laue's
  experiment

- The images surrounding the center could be interpreted as the reflection
  of the X-Ray beam on a unique set of lattice planes

    - Each image corresponds to a different set of planes

- They determined Bragg's law, which can be used to determine both wavelength
  and lattice spacing

# De Broglie Waves


## History

- The Bohr model needed to be replaced by a more general one

- Theorized by French graduate student, Prince Louis V. de Broglie

- Presented in his doctoral thesis to the University of Paris in 1924

- Awarded Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929


## Theory

- If light can behave as a particle and a wave, then why not matter particles?

- The wavelength of a material particle, when converted into a photon of equal
  energy and momentum, will have a wavelength given by:

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2-> {
  \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
}
\end{displaymath}


## Agreement with Bohr Model

- Imagine the electron in a Hydrogen atom as a standing wave orbiting the
  proton

\begin{displaymath}
  n \lambda = 2\pi r
\end{displaymath}

- Substitute de Broglie relation for wavelength

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
  n \frac{h}{p} = 2\pi r
}
\end{displaymath}

- Angular momentum given by $L = rp$

\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
  L = rp = \frac{n h}{2 \pi} = n \hbar
}
\end{displaymath}


# Electron Scattering

## History

- In 1925 C. Davison and L. H. Germer had a lab accident which led to
  experimental proof for the de Broglie wavelength hypothesis.

- Davison and Germer were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their
  discovery.

## Experiment

- Davison and Germer were experimenting with electron scattering from various
  metals in the lab.

- A bottle exploded, causing air to rush into a vacuum and thus quickly oxidize
  an expensive nickel target.

- They tried to deoxidize the nickel by raising its temperature very high while
  in hydrogen or in a vacuum.

- They continued the experiment after deoxidization and found significantly
  different results. It appeared as though the structure of the crystals that
  made up the material had changed.

- It seemed that the electrons acted like x rays as they diffracted in a new
  pattern based on the changed interatomic spacing within the material.

# Wave Motion


## History

- As the discoveries of de Broglie rocked the world of physics, new ways of
  looking at the world developed.

- One of these ways included looking at waves as a representation of matter

## Theory

- Since matter can behave like a wave, it is possible to represent matter by a
  wave function.

- In their simplest form, these waves can be described by the equation

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
\Psi (x,t) = A \sin (kx - \omega t + \phi)
}
\end{displaymath}

## Principle of Superposition

- When two or more waves traverse the same region, they act independently, and
  the sum of individual displacements gives the total displacement

- Multiple waves can interfere constructively or destructively

- The superposition of $n$ sine waves is given by the Fourier series:

\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
\Psi(x, t) = \sum_{j=1}^n A_j \sin(k_j x - \omega_j t) \diff k
}
\end{displaymath}

- For a continuous spectrum, the series is extended to a Fourier integral

\begin{displaymath}
\only<4->{
\Psi(x, t) = \int \tilde{A}(k) \cos(k x - \omega t)
}
\end{displaymath}

## Wave Packets

- A large set of sinusoids with different wavenumbers $k$ may interfere such
  that the amplitude of their superposition is close to zero except for a
  localized region $\Delta x$

- In order to shrink the region $\Delta x$, the range of wavenumbers $\Delta k$
  must be correspondingly large

- This is related to the uncertainty principle

## Wave Equation

- In general, the equation of a wave is given by

\begin{displaymath}
  \frac{1}{v^2} \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi = \nabla^2 \Psi
\end{displaymath}

- In one dimension, this is simplified to

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
  \frac{1}{v^2} \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x, t) = \parfrac{^2}{x^2} \Psi(x, t)
}
\end{displaymath}

## Derivation of Wave Equation in 1D

- Imagine an array of masses $m$ separated by displacement $h$ by springs with
  spring constant $k$

- $\Psi(x)$ represents the displacement from equilibrium of the mass at $x$

![](img/wave-equation-hooke-derivation)

## Derivation of Wave Equation in 1D (cont)

\begin{gather*}
F_{x+h} = m a = m \cdot \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x+h)
\\ \only<2->{
F_{x+h} = F_{x+2h} - F_x =
k \left\{
  \left[ \Psi(x + 2h) - \Psi(x + h) \right]
- \left[ \Psi(x + h)  - \Psi(x)     \right]
\right\}
}
\\ \only<3->{
m \cdot \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x+h) =
k \left\{
  \left[ \Psi(x + 2h) - \Psi(x + h) \right]
- \left[ \Psi(x + h)  - \Psi(x)     \right]
\right\}
}
\\ \only<4->{
m \cdot \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x+h) =
k \left[ \Psi(x + 2h) - 2 \Psi(x + h) + \Psi(x) \right]
}
\end{gather*}

## Derivation of Wave Equation in 1D (cont)

- $N$ weights

- Total length: $L = Nh$

- Total mass: $M = Nm$

- Total spring constant: $K = \frac{k}{N}$

## Derivation of Wave Equation in 1D (cont)

\begin{displaymath}
\parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x+h) =
\frac{K L^2}{M}
\frac{\left[ \Psi(x + 2h) - 2 \Psi(x + h) + \Psi(x) \right]}{h^2}
\end{displaymath}

\pause
- Take the limit as $N \to \infty$ and $h \to 0$

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
\parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x, t) = \frac{K L^2}{M} \parfrac{^2}{x^2} \Psi(x, t)
}
\end{displaymath}

\pause
- $K L^2 / M$ is the square of phase velocity, $v$

\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
\parfrac{^2}{x^2} \Psi(x, t) = \frac{1}{v^2} \parfrac{^2}{t^2} \Psi(x, t)
}
\end{displaymath}


# Waves or Particles

## Double-Slit Experiment with Light

- Apparatus consists of a wall with two small slits, a screen behind it, and a
  low-power laser

- Laser is directed at the two slits

- If one slit is covered, a single, broad peak is observed on the screen

- If both slits are uncovered, an interference pattern is observed

- This demonstrates the wave-nature of light

## Particle Nature of Light

- If the intensity of the light is reduced, we observe discrete flashes of
  light on the screen

- Over time, the sum of these flashes recreates the interference pattern

## Particle Nature of Electrons

- Electron de Broglie wavelengths are much shorter than that of light

    - Electrons with $E = 50$keV have $\lambda = 5 \times 10^{-3}$nm

    - Compare to the size of hydrogen atom ($~0.1$nm)

- Slit size must be correspondingly small

- C. Jönsson demonstrated this with very small slits and large distance to
  observation screen

- The same nature was observed for electrons as was observed for light



# Uncertainty Principle

## Theory

- In the case of a Gaussian wave packet

\begin{displaymath}
\Delta k \Delta x = \frac{\Delta p}{\hbar} \Delta x = \frac{1}{2}
\implies
\Delta p \Delta x = \frac{\hbar}{2}
\end{displaymath}

- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states

\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
\Delta p_x \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
}
\end{displaymath}

- Time-energy form

\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
}
\end{displaymath}

# Probability, Wave Functions, and the Copenhagen Interpretation

## Wave Function

- The wave function $\Psi(x, t)$ describes the superposition of waves which
  comprise the wave packet

- In electrodynamics, $\mathbf{E}$ or $\mathbf{B}$ serves as the wave function

- For matter waves, $\Psi$ determines the probability of finding a particle
  at a particular location in space at a time $t$

## Probability Density

- The quantity $|\Psi|^2$ is called the probability density

- Represents the probability of finding the particle in a given volume at a
  time $t$

- If $\Psi$ is complex, $\Psi^* \Psi$ is used when finding probabilities

- When only interested in a single dimension $y$ at a given time $t$,
  $P(y) = \Psi^* \Psi = |\Psi|^2$ is the probability of observing a particle
  in the interval between $y$ and $y + \diff y$

## Normalization

- The probability of finding a particle *somewhere* must be unity, and so the
  probability density is integrated over all space

\begin{displaymath}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty P(y) \diff y =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\Psi(y, t)|^2 \diff y = 1
\end{displaymath}

## Copenhagen Interpretation

- Assumes that the wavefunction is real

- When a particle is observed, one of the many possible states described by the
  wavefunction is chosen at random

- Before that observation, nothing could be said about the location of the
  particle beyond the wavefunction

- Initially met with much resistance from physicists, but now the most widely
  accepted interpretation

    - Einstein stated "God does not throw dice" in defiance of the
      interpretation

# Particle in a Box

## Theory

- A particle's position in a box can be represented by a wave function
  describing the probability of finding the particle at a certain location

- This probability must fall to zero at either end, so only integer multiples
  of half wavelengths will fit into the box

- The length of the box can be $\ell$ as defined by

\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
\ell = \frac{n \lambda}{2}
\text{, for } n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
}
\end{displaymath}

- The possible values of $\lambda$ are quantized as a result, giving discrete
  energy levels of the particle. This explains the Bohr model
