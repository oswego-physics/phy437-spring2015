# Hilbert Space

## Linear Algebra

- quantum theory is based on *wave functions* and *operators*
- the state of a system is represented by its wave function
- observables are represented by operators
- wave functions satisfy the defining conditions for *abstract vectors*
- operators act on them as *linear transformations*


## Vectors

- in an $N$-dimensional space, a vector $\ket\alpha$ may be represented by the
  $N$-tuple of its components, $\{ a_n \}$, with respect to a specified
  orthonormal basis
\begin{displaymath}
\ket\alpha \to \mathbf{a} =
\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_N \end{pmatrix}
\end{displaymath}
- the "vectors" in quantum mechanics are typically functions, existing in
  *infinite*-dimensional spaces
    - the $N$-tuple notation used to represent finite-dimensional vectors
      becomes problematic

## Bra--ket Notation

- the inner product of two vectors, $\ket\alpha$ and $\ket\beta$, is a
  generalization of the dot product, and is denoted $\braket{\alpha}{\beta}$
\begin{displaymath}
\braket{\alpha}{\beta} =
a_1^* b_1 + a_2^* b_2 + \ldots + a_N^* b_N
\end{displaymath}
- here, $\bra\alpha$ is called the "bra", and $\ket\beta$ is called the "ket"
- when $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are functions on the interval $\intoo{a,b}$,
  the inner product is given by the familiar integral
\begin{displaymath}
\only<3->{
\braket{\alpha}{\beta} =
\int_a^b \alpha(x)^* \beta(x) \dif x
}
\end{displaymath}


## Hilbert Space

- a wave function must be normalized, i.e.
\begin{displaymath}
\braket\Psi =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \Psi^* \Psi \dif x =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \abs{\Psi}^2 \dif x =
1
\end{displaymath}
- a function, $f(x)$ is *square-integrable* if, on a specified interval
  $\intoo{a,b}$
\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
\braket{f} = \int_a^b \abs{f(x)}^2 \dif x < \infty
}
\end{displaymath}
- the set of all such functions is called *Hilbert space*
    - mathematicians call this $L_2(a, b)$
- wave functions live in Hilbert space


## Schwarz Inequality

- the integral Schwarz inequality states
\begin{displaymath}
\abs{\int_a^b f(x)^* g(x) \dif x}
\leq
\sqrt{
  \int_a^b \abs{f(x)}^2 \dif x
  \int_a^b \abs{g(x)}^2 \dif x
}
\end{displaymath}
- all functions that live in Hilbert space are square integrable
    - they have finite square integrals
- as a result, the right the right hand side of the Schwarz inequality is
  guaranteed to be finite for all functions $f, g \in L_2(a,b)$
- the left side, or the magnitude of the inner product of our two functions,
  must be finite as well


## Some Properties of Inner Products

- if $f$ and $g$ are both square-integrable, then $\braket{f}{g}$ is guaranteed
  to exist
- $\braket{g}{f} = \braket{f}{g}^*$
- $\braket{f}$ is real and non-negative, and zero only if $f(x) \equiv 0$
- $f$ is normalized if $\braket{f} = 1$
- $f$ and $g$ are orthogonal if $\braket{f}{g} = 0$
- a set of functions $\{ f_n \}$ is orthonormal if
  $\braket{f_m}{f_n} = \delta_{mn}$

## Complete Functions

- a set of functions $\{ f_n \}$ is said to be *complete* if any *other*
  function in Hilbert space can be expressed as a linear combination of them
\begin{displaymath}
f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n f_n(x)
\end{displaymath}
- if the functions $\{ f_n \}$ are orthonormal, then their coefficients may
  be obtained by Fourier's trick: $c_n = \braket{f_n}{f}$
- the stationary states $\{ \psi_n \}$ for the infinite square well form a
  complete orthonormal set on the interval $\intoo{0,a}$
- the stationary states for the harmonic oscillator form a complete orthonormal
  set on the interval $\intoo{-\infty,\infty}$

# Observables

## Hermitian Operators

- the expectation value of an operator $Q(x,p)$ can be expressed as
\begin{displaymath}
\expval{Q} = \int \Psi^* \hat{Q} \Psi \dif x = \braket{\Psi}{\hat{Q}\Psi}
\end{displaymath}
- the outcome of a measurement must be real, therefore
  $\expval{Q} = \expval{Q}^*$
- but the complex conjugate reverses the order, meaning
  $\braket{\Psi}{\hat{Q}\Psi} = \braket{\hat{Q}\Psi}{\Psi}$
- all operators representing *observables* possess this property
- such operators are called *hermitian*


## Determinate States

- in general, if you observe $Q$ on a set of systems in the identical state
  $\Psi$, you do not obtain the same result each time
- this is the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics
- a *determinate* state, for a given observable $Q$, is a special case,
  in which each observation gives the same value, $q$


## Determinate States

- the standard deviation of an observable $Q$, in a determinate state would be
  zero
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2 &=
\expval{(\hat{Q} - \expval{Q})^2}
\\ &=
\braket{\Psi}{(\hat{Q}-q)^2 \Psi}
\\ &=
\braket{(\hat{Q}-q) \Psi}{(\hat{Q}-q) \Psi} = 0
\end{align*}
- the only function whose inner product with itself vanishes is zero
\begin{displaymath}
\only<2->{
(\hat{Q}-q) \Psi = 0 \implies \hat{Q} \Psi = q \Psi
}
\end{displaymath}
- $\Psi$ is an eigenfunction for $\hat{Q}$, with eigenvalue $q$
- all determinate states are eigenfunctions of $\hat{Q}$

## Spectrum

- the collection of all eigenvalues of an operator is called its *spectrum*
- in the case where two or more linearly independent eigenfunctions share an
  eigenvalue, the spectrum is said to be *degenerate*



## Hamiltonian

- stationary states are determinate states of the Hamiltonian
- they are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, with eigenvalue $E$:
  $\hat{H} \psi = E \psi$
- including the time dependence $\varphi(t)$ to make it $\Psi$ does not change
  the fact that it is an eigenfunction of $\hat{H}$


## Thank you!
